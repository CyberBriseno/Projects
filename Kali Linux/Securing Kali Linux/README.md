Step 3: Strengthen SSH
Step 4: Install Intrusion Detection Tools
Step 5: Minimize the Attack Surface
Prerequisites
Active Kali Linux VM on Hyper-V
Administrative privileges on both Windows Host and Kali VM
Access to the Internet
(Optional) Screenshots can be placed in a screenshots folder for clarity.

Step 1: Update and Upgrade System
Open Terminal in Kali.
Run: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
Clean up redundant packages: sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt clean
Reboot the VM to finalize updates.
Step 2: Configure a Firewall
Install ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall): sudo apt install ufw -y
Enable and configure basic rules: sudo ufw default deny incoming sudo ufw default allow outgoing sudo ufw enable
(Optional) Customize rules for specific services (e.g., SSH): sudo ufw allow ssh
Step 3: Strengthen SSH
Edit SSH configuration: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Disable root login and password authentication: PermitRootLogin no PasswordAuthentication no
Use key-based authentication whenever feasible:
Generate a key pair on your local machine with ssh-keygen.
Copy the public key to the VM using ssh-copy-id.
Restart SSH: sudo systemctl restart ssh
Step 4: Install Intrusion Detection Tools
Consider installing fail2ban: sudo apt install fail2ban -y
Configure fail2ban:
Edit /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf to tailor settings (like bantime, maxretry).
Restart fail2ban: sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
(Optional) Incorporate IDS/IPS solutions such as Snort or Suricata.
Step 5: Minimize the Attack Surface
Uninstall or disable unnecessary services:
Identify running services with systemctl --type=service.
Stop and disable any superfluous ones.
Use strong passwords or key-based authentication for all accounts.
Keep software packages and Kali tools updated:
Routinely check for new updates and apply security patches.
Implement secure permissions on sensitive files: chmod 600 for confidential configs containing private keys or credentials.
