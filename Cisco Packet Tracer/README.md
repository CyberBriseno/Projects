# Cisco Network

## Objective
This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of my current level of proficiency in networking. The entire network is designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer with the aim of enabling effective network communication via ICMP packets.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network Design
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Routing Protocols (OSPF/Static Routes)
- VLAN Configuration
- Access Control Lists (ACL)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)

## Replication
To replicate this network I have a PDF in this repository a topology of the network and directions.
